## Add Service Plans for AI Core and Object Store
To create service instances of AI Core and Object Store on a subaccount, one first has to add the respective service plans and give entitlements.

Follow the procedure from [Add a Service Plan](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/86002d926eba4fb9ba0a80e342af7295.html?locale=en-US) on 
from the overall guide [Provision AI Core (incl.
Subaccount)](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/38c4599432d74c1d94e70f7c955a717d.html?locale=en-US).
Since a subaccount for the purpose of AI Launchpad was already created through the
booster, it's not necessary to follow the whole guide. Besides adding the service plan and
creating an instance only for AI Core, perform the same steps also for the Object Store:
