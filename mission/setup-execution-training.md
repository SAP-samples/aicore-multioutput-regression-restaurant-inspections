# Setup and Execution of Training in AI Core

In order to train the model, you first need to create a *training configuration*. It keeps
information about which workflow to use, what the input artifact is (here the
training dataset) and some more metadata like the ID of the AI Scenario. AI Core can in
turn execute the model training according to this configuration.

## Training Configuration

To create a training configuration, run the following code:

```python
input_artifact_name = training_workflow['spec']['templates'][0]['inputs']['artifacts'][0]['name']
executable_name = training_workflow['metadata']['name']

artifact_binding = {
    "key": input_artifact_name,
    "artifact_id": artifact_resp.id
}

train_configuration = {
    "name": resource_group,
    "scenario_id": scenario_id,
    "executable_id": executable_name,
    "parameter_bindings": [],
    "input_artifact_bindings": [ InputArtifactBinding(**artifact_binding) ]
}

train_config_resp = ai_api_v2_client.configuration.create(**train_configuration)
pprint(vars(train_config_resp))

assert train_config_resp.message == 'Configuration created'

print("Configuration created for running the training")
```

If the configuration has been created successfully, the configuration should also be
listed in AI Launchpad under the ML Operations > Configurations tab. Make sure to select
your respective resource group for this mission beforehand in the Workspaces tab on the
left.

## Training Execution

Now it is time to finally initiate the training:

```python
execution_resp = ai_api_v2_client.execution.create(train_config_resp.id)
pprint(vars(execution_resp))

status = None
while status != Status.COMPLETED and status != Status.DEAD:
    time.sleep(5)
    clear_output(wait=True)

    execution = ai_api_v2_client.execution.get(execution_resp.id)
    status = execution.status
    print('...... execution status ......', flush=True)
    print(f"Training status: {execution.status}")
    print(f"Training status details: {execution.status_details}")


if execution.status == Status.COMPLETED:
    print(f"Training complete for execution [{execution_resp.id}]!")
    output_artifact = execution.output_artifacts[0]
    output = {
        "id": output_artifact.id,
        "name": output_artifact.name,
        "url": output_artifact.url
    }
    with open('../training_output.json', 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(output, fp)
```

AI Core will now take some time to finish the training of the model. Once it has finished
the execution should be also marked as finished in AI Launchpad.
