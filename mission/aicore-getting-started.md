# Get started with SAP AI Core

SAP AI Core is part of the services portfolio that SAP BTP provides. It is used to
train a machine learning model and to deploy the model in the form of a service running
in the cloud on SAP BTP. Clients can then send data to the service endpoint and will receive the model's
prediction based on that data as a response. Both model training and serving happen in a scalable and for the most part hyperscaler-agnostic way.

AI Core will play an important role during this mission. Therefore, before proceeding
with the mission, it is recommended to first get a basic understanding of AI Core.

Skim through the [AI Core
documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/d029a32c22fb45fbb607e6a2c48c8a0e.html)
to get a first overview of what it is all
about. As a next step, you might want to go through a
[tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/group.ai-core-get-started-basics.html) that
showcases how to use it. In this tutorial follow the track that uses the [AI Core
Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/ai-core-sdk/) in order to interact with AI Core programmatically in plain python.
