# Get started with SAP AI Core

SAP AI Core is part of the SAP BTP services portfolio. It is used to
train and deploy machine learning models in the cloud. Once a model is trained, clients can send data to the service endpoint to receive
predictions based on that model and data. Both model training and serving happen in a scalable way, and are hyperscaler-agnostic for the most part.

AI Core is central to this mission. Here are some resources that help you to get a basic understanding of AI Core.

- Basicss [tutorial group](https://developers.sap.com/group.ai-core-get-started-basics.html). In this tutorial follow the track that uses the [AI Core
Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/ai-core-sdk/) in order to interact with AI Core programmatically in plain python.
- The full [AI Core
documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/d029a32c22fb45fbb607e6a2c48c8a0e.html)

***You might want to suggest an early completion point as the tutorial group goes through a whole project in itself. Some individual tutorials in the group help with the initial setup, you could specify those and then direct the user back to the mission.
